    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It models real-world entities through concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Its main goal is to bind data and the functions that operate on that data together, facilitating modularity, code reusability, and easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (member functions) that the created objects will have. Classes represent broad categories or types of objects sharing common features and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It encapsulates both state (attributes/variables) and behavior (methods/functions), and it can interact with other objects. Each object occupies memory uniquely and operates as a reusable unit of code with specific data and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "Abstraction hides the complex implementation details and shows only the functionality to the user. It is focused on what an object does.\n",
    "Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit and restricting access via access modifiers or conventions, focused on how data is protected.\n",
    "Abstraction is implemented via abstract classes/interfaces, while encapsulation is implemented using access controls like private variables and public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "Dunder (double underscore) methods are special pre-defined methods surrounded by double underscores (e.g., _init, __str, __add_). They enable operator overloading and enable custom behaviors for built-in functions and operators. These are also called magic methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (attributes & methods) of another class (parent or superclass). It enables code reuse, hierarchical class organization, and the extension or customization of inherited functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "Polymorphism literally means \"many forms\". In OOP, it refers to the ability of different classes to be treated through a common interface, typically by overriding methods or using method overloading. It allows one interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "Python uses conventions rather than strict access modifiers. Encapsulation is achieved by prefixing variables/methods with underscores:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single underscore _var indicates protected (by convention).\n",
    "\n",
    "Double underscore __var invokes name mangling to make it harder to access externally (private).\n",
    "Additionally, access is controlled through getter/setter methods or property decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "A constructor is a special method _init_ that initializes an object’s attributes when an instance of a class is created. It sets the initial state and is called automatically during object instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "A class method (decorated with @classmethod) receives the class (cls) as the first argument and can access class variables or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A static method (decorated with @staticmethod) does not receive an implicit first argument (neither instance nor class) and behaves like a regular function within the class namespace.\n",
    "Class methods are used for factory methods or methods affecting the class, while static methods are utility functions related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "Python does not support method overloading in the classical sense (multiple methods with same name but different parameters). Instead, it can be simulated by default parameters, variable-length argument lists, or explicit type checking inside a single method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "Method overriding happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass, allowing the subclass to modify or extend behavior. The overridden method in the child class will be called instead of the parent's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method that acts like a read-only attribute. It allows controlled access to private variables with getter, setter, and deleter methods, enabling encapsulation with attribute-like syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility by allowing different classes to be used interchangeably through a common interface. It simplifies code and improves maintainability by allowing new classes to be integrated with minimal changes to existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and often contains one or more abstract methods (declared but not implemented). It serves as a blueprint for subclasses that must implement the abstract methods. Python supports abstract classes via the abc module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "Advantages include modularity, code reusability, scalability, easier maintenance, abstraction, encapsulation for security, inheritance for extending behavior, polymorphism for flexibility, and modeling of real-world entities naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "A class variable is shared by all instances of a class; it belongs to the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance variable is unique to each instance (object) and stores data specific to that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from more than one parent class, inheriting attributes and methods from all parents. Python supports this feature, enabling more flexible and complex class hierarchies.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of _str_ and _repr_ methods in Python\n",
    "_str_ defines the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object, used by print() and str().\n",
    "\n",
    "_repr_ defines the “official” string representation, aimed at developers, intended to be unambiguous and ideally valid Python code to recreate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
    "super() is used to call a method from a parent class inside a subclass, enabling the reuse and extension of inherited methods, facilitating cooperative multiple inheritance and method resolution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the _del_ method in Python?\n",
    "_del_ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It allows cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources, but its use is generally discouraged due to unpredictable invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "@staticmethod defines a method that does not receive any implicit first argument and behaves like a regular function inside the class body.\n",
    "\n",
    "@classmethod receives the class itself as the first argument and can modify class state that applies across all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "In Python, polymorphism allows derived classes to override methods of a base class, so the same method call can invoke different behaviors depending on the object’s class at runtime. This is supported by dynamic typing and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement, usually achieved by returning self from each method to allow consecutive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the _call_ method in Python?\n",
    "_call_ allows an instance of a class to be called as a function. By implementing this method, objects become callable and can accept arguments like a regular function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
